# Project 2: Solving Problems by Searching

**Due Sunday, February 26 at 11:59 PM**

*If you choose, you may work with a partner to complete this assignment.*

## Description

This project will let you solve some problems using breadth-first
and depth-first searching strategies.

For each problem, think carefully about how to design an effective
solution. This includes:

  - Choice of search algorithm (breadth vs. depth, iterative vs. recursive)
  
  - How to represent the problem state and solution path (classes may be helpful for problems 2 and 3)
  
  - How to implement state transitions
  
  - How to check for feasibility and eliminate unproductive search paths
  
There may be many different ways of approaching these problems that are equally valid.
Part of the challenge of this project is thinking carefully about the design decisions
you make, their tradeoffs, and their implementation details.

Submit your project through GitHub, with one Python script for each problem. If you work
with a partner, you will both submit the same code and receive the same grade.

For each problem, I'll check the output of your program and examine the details of your implementation.
To receive full credit, your program must produce the correct output, you must use 
a breadth-first or depth-first search, and you must clearly explain all relevant details of your
problem formulation and implementation.

## Warm-Up: Anagrams

Find all of the anagrams in the word list. Your program should
scan through the word list and print each group of words with the
same letters on a single line. For example,

```
['buffered', 'rebuffed']
['biders', 'brides', 'debris', 'rebids']
['gateman', 'magenta', 'magnate']
['stewed', 'tweeds']
['basest', 'basset', 'bastes', 'beasts']
['rationalizes', 'realizations']
['night', 'thing']
['dares', 'dears', 'rased', 'reads']
```   
   
You could do this by comparing every word in the word list to
every other word and seeing if they contain the same letters, but
that would have O(N^2) complexity, which is lame.

A better solution makes only one pass through the list using a
dictionary to store all of the sets of words with the same letters.
The values in the dictionary would be the lists of words that are
anagrams of each other. What shoud the keys be?

Hints:

  - If word is a string, what is sorted(word)?
    
  - You can turn a list into a tuple using tuple()
    
  - Tuples can be dictionary keys
    
## Word Ladders

This is inspired by a problem from `leetcode.com`.

Given a `start_word` and an `end_word`, generate a chain of words that 
connects the two. Each word in the chain may differ from the previous
word by only one letter.

For example,

```    
dog
cog
cot
cat
``` 

You may assume the length of the word remains constant. Use `words.txt`
as your reference.

Find a ladder connecting `snakes` and `brains`.

Hint: For fast word lookups, make a dictionary with all of the words
in the list as its keys. The dictionary's values can be anything.
You can then check if a word is in the list using

```
if word in all_words:
```

## Boggle

Boggle is a popular word game played with a 4x4 grid of letter dice.
The goal is to identify the most words in the grid by connecting
letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

For example, for the grid

```
u n t h
g a e s
s r t r
h m i a
```

some of the words you can generate include `tars`, `hermits`, `gates`,
`miters`, `great`, `irate`, `guar`, and `gathers`.

The same grid position can't be used multiple times in one word.

Write a program that can find as many words as possible in a 4x4
grid. Any word in `words.txt` is valid.

I recommend having a search method that takes a starting location in
the grid as its input argument. The search routine then returns all
the words that can be built off of that starting letter. For example,
search(1, 3) would return all words that can be built starting with
the `s` in the second row. Call this method 16 times, once for each 
starting position.

Some other considerations:
  
  - Use the example grid for testing.
  
  - You'll need a way to keep track of the sequence of letters
    belonging to each candidate word, to ensure that you don't use
    the same square twice. A list of tuples might do the job. For
    example,    
    ```
    [(1, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]
    ```    
    corresponds to the positions of the word `star`.     
    
  - You can check if an item is in a list using the in operator:    
    ```
    if position in position_list:
    ```    
  
  - To make this efficient, you shouldn't waste time exploring
    paths that can't lead to solutions. For example, there are no
    words in the list that begin with gt-, fn-, or ds-, so those 
    prefixes can never lead to useful solutions and should be 
    dropped from the search. Perhaps a dictionary that stores all
    prefixes in the word list would help?
